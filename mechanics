Classical mechanics John. Taylor
//ch1
reference frames
mass, force exerted by particle A to particle B where A is not B(by third law,this should be the definition)
//(i think)a force is a functor:F:A->B
point mass = particle
inertial frames
net force (with respect to system of particles)
external force (with respect to system of particles)
momentum (with respect to system of particles)

//ch3
center of mass (wrt. sop.)
angular momentum (wrt. sop.)
torque exerted by particle A to particle B where A is not B(definition of torque inherits that of force)

//ch4
kinetic energy (wrt. sop.)
work (wrt. a force(as a functor) and the movement of the codomain of the force)
conservative force
potential energy (wrt. sop.)
mechanical energy (wrt. sop.)
time-dependent potential energy

//ch7
Lagrangian
generalized force, generalized momentum, generalized coordinates
natural coordinates
degrees of freedom, constrained system
(non)holonomic
constraint forces, total potential energy of non-constraint forces
ignorable coordinates
Lagrange multiplier

这玩意儿是怎么被发明的呢？大概是strong analogy with Fermat principle，然而这个analogy也绝不显然。。
