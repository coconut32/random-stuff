Problems and theorems in linear algebra

Techniques
T1.mathematical induction
T2.pretend variable as constant
T3.substitute and compute
T4.view the left action by a matrix as row operation
T5.work on the level of block
T6.decomposition into products (maybe by guesswork)

1.1 (Cramer rule) 
Pf1.do T1. the base step is trivial, for the induction step, use T2.
Pf2.do T3 to rhs.

1.7 (generalization of row operation)
Pf1.use T4.
Pf2.use T5 combined with T6.

2.2
Pf1.immediate by contradiction.
Pf2.compute to construct an explicit linear relationship.
